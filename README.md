# Neon Tides: Pirate Legacy

An **offline** retro-futuristic pixel-art pirate action RPG for **Android**, built with **Godot 4.3+ / GDScript**.

> **IP note.** This is an *original* game in the anime-pirate-adventure genre. It doesn't use
> the names, characters, ships, places or art of any existing franchise. All content
> (crew, islands, items) is data-driven in `data/*.json`.

## Status: Phase 1 (Project Foundation) ✅ complete and verified

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Project config, Android/pixel settings, folder architecture, global managers, save system | **Done (34/34 tests pass)** |
| 2 | Main menu, New Game / Continue, character selection | Next |

### What Phase 1 actually does

| System | File | Verified behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| **EventBus** | `scripts/managers/event_bus.gd` | Global decoupled signals |
| **Settings** | `scripts/managers/settings_manager.gd` | `user://settings.cfg`; every value clamped or whitelisted; a corrupt file falls back to defaults; 30/60 FPS cap; vsync |
| **AudioManager** | `scripts/managers/audio_manager.gd` | Music/SFX/UI buses, pooled SFX players, music crossfade, **13 procedurally generated offline SFX** (drop `assets/audio/sfx/<id>.ogg` to replace any of them) |
| **DataRegistry** | `scripts/managers/data_registry.gd` | Loads and validates `data/**.json` (10 crew, 3 seas, 25 islands, 12 items); catches duplicate IDs and missing fields |
| **SaveManager** | `scripts/save_system/save_manager.gd` | Autosave slot + 3 manual slots, SHA-256 checksum, atomic write (tmp → verify → rotate backup), automatic backup restore, version check and migration hook, slot metadata, "Continue" target |
| **GameManager** | `scripts/managers/game_manager.gd` | New game, load/save, type-safe merge for old saves, EXP curve, multi-level-up, derived stats, gold, play time |
| **SceneManager** | `scripts/managers/scene_manager.gd` | Fade transitions with threaded loading, global neon theme, FPS overlay |
| **InputConfig** | `scripts/managers/input_config.gd` | 15 actions (move, jump, attack, dodge, block, skill 1–3, ultimate, interact, pause, back) with keyboard + gamepad bindings |
| **Platform** | `scripts/android/platform_bridge.gd` | Android back-button handler stack; autosave on app pause, focus loss or close; keeps the screen awake |

There is **no networking code anywhere**, and the Android preset has the `INTERNET` permission turned off (a test enforces this).

## Project settings (`project.godot`)

- Internal resolution **640×360**, stretch `canvas_items`, aspect `expand` (fills any phone aspect ratio)
- **Nearest-neighbor** texture filter, 2D transform and vertex pixel snapping
- Orientation **sensor landscape**; `quit_on_go_back=false` (back is handled in code)
- Renderer **GL Compatibility** (widest Android GPU support, low battery use)
- ETC2/ASTC texture compression enabled (needed for Android export)
- Autoload order matters: `EventBus → Settings → AudioManager → DataRegistry → SaveManager → GameManager → SceneManager → InputConfig → Platform`

## Scene trees

**`scenes/main/SplashScreen.tscn`** (`scripts/main/splash_screen.gd`)
```
SplashScreen (Control, full rect)
├── Backdrop (Control + neon_backdrop.gd)      animated sky, sun, sea grid, waves
├── TitleBox (VBoxContainer, top 42%)
│   ├── %Title     (Label)
│   ├── %Subtitle  (Label)
│   └── %Tagline   (Label)
├── %TapLabel      (Label, bottom center, blinking)
└── %VersionLabel  (Label, bottom right)
```
Advances on tap, click or `ui_accept`, or after 4 s, to `NEXT_SCENE`. In Phase 2 that becomes `MainMenu.tscn`.

**`scenes/main/BootCheck.tscn`** (`scripts/main/boot_check.gd`)
```
BootCheck (Control)
├── Backdrop (Control + neon_backdrop.gd)
└── Panel (PanelContainer)
    └── VBox
        ├── %Header, %Info (Label)
        ├── Scroll (ScrollContainer) └── %Results (VBoxContainer)   rows built in code
        └── Footer (HBox) ── %Summary (Label), %RerunButton, %TitleButton
```
This screen runs `SystemCheck` on the device itself, so storage, saving and audio get verified on real Android hardware.

## Folder structure

```
assets/      characters enemies bosses environments islands ships effects icons audio/{music,sfx} fonts
scenes/      main menus characters combat enemies bosses islands ships ui quests
scripts/     managers player combat enemies bosses inventory quests dialogue save_system android ui main debug
resources/   items skills characters quests dialogue
data/        characters enemies items islands quests      (JSON content)
tests/       headless test runner (excluded from export)
```

## Save format

`user://saves/slot_N.json` (slot 0 = autosave, slots 1–3 = manual) and `slot_N.bak.json`:
```json
{ "magic": "NEONTIDES", "version": 1, "saved_at": "...", "saved_at_unix": 0,
  "meta": { "character_name": "...", "level": 1, "island_name": "...", "gold": 100, "play_time_sec": 0 },
  "checksum": "<sha256 of payload>", "payload": "<game state as JSON string>" }
```

## Running

1. Install **Godot 4.3+** (standard build, not .NET).
2. Open `project.godot` in the editor and press **F5**.
   Desktop keys: WASD/arrows move, Space jump, J attack, L dodge, Q block, U/I/O skills, R ultimate, E interact, P pause, Esc back.

### Tests (headless)
```bash
godot --headless --path . --import
```
```bash
godot --headless --path . res://tests/TestRunner.tscn
```
The runner exits with code 0 only if all checks pass. Some `ERROR`/`WARNING` lines are expected because the tests feed bad input on purpose (an unknown character, a tampered save, slot 42).

## Exporting the Android APK

1. **Editor → Manage Export Templates → Download** (must match your Godot version).
2. Install **JDK 17** and the **Android SDK** (platform-tools, build-tools 34, platform 34). The easiest route is Android Studio.
3. **Editor Settings → Export → Android**: set the *Java SDK Path* and *Android SDK Path*. A debug keystore is created automatically.
4. **Project → Export → Android** (the preset is already in `export_presets.cfg`):
   arm64-v8a and armeabi-v7a, immersive mode on, `INTERNET` off, `data/*.json` included, `tests/*` excluded.
5. Click **Export Project** to produce `build/android/NeonTides.apk`, or use **Remote Debug** (one-click deploy) with a USB-connected phone that has developer mode on.
6. For a release build: create a keystore and set it under *Keystore → Release* in the preset. Keep it out of git (it's already in `.gitignore`).

On first launch the phone should show **"29 / 29 SYSTEMS ONLINE"** on the BootCheck screen. (The headless runner adds 5 project-file checks, for 34 in total.)

## Imported art (asset packs)

Three uploaded prototype packs were merged, with duplicates removed (77 PNGs). Each pack's notes say it is original generated pixel art containing no official franchise artwork; see `assets/ASSET_PACK_IP_NOTE.txt` and `assets/ASSET_PACK_LICENSE.txt`.

| Folder | Contents | Layout |
|---|---|---|
| `assets/characters/sheets/` | 10 crew sheets (main skin) | 8×8 grid, 32×40 frames, rows: idle, walk, run, jump, attack, special, hurt, death |
| `assets/characters/sheets_alt/` | 10 alternate crew skins | same |
| `assets/characters/portraits/` | 10 portraits, 96×120 | — |
| `assets/enemies/` | Navy grunt, pirate raider, bounty hunter, sea beast | 6×4 grid, 32×40 frames |
| `assets/bosses/` | Island warlord | 6×4 grid, 64×64 frames |
| `assets/effects/` | fire burst, haki aura, impact, lightning, smoke, water splash | 8×4 grid, 32×32 frames |
| `assets/islands/backgrounds/` | 6 island backgrounds, 640×360 | — |
| `assets/environments/tiles/` | 16 px world tile atlas | 8×4 tiles |
| `assets/ships/`, `assets/icons/`, `assets/ui/{buttons,touch,hud}/` | Sloop, 9 item icons and a 24 px icon atlas, menu and touch buttons, joystick, HUD bars, panel | — |

All asset paths live in data: `data/characters/crew.json` (`sprite.sheet / alt_sheet / portrait`), `data/enemies/enemies.json`, `data/islands/islands.json` (`background`) and `data/items/*.json` (`icon`). `data/sprite_layouts.json` defines each sheet grid, plus FPS, looping and aliases (`victory` → `special`, enemy `death` → `hurt`). `SpriteSheetLibrary` (`scripts/animation/sprite_sheet_library.gd`) turns a sheet into cached `SpriteFrames`. It checks each sheet's size against its layout and reports a mismatch as an error. DataRegistry flags any data entry that points to a missing file.

**Preview:** BootCheck → **GALLERY** (or run `scenes/debug/AssetGallery.tscn`). It cycles animations, islands and skins. From the command line: `godot --path . res://scenes/debug/AssetGallery.tscn -- --anim=attack --bg=2 --alt`

**Gaps in the packs:** no victory row and no enemy death rows (aliased for now), no portraits for the alternate skins, no music or SFX (the procedural placeholders stay), and no pixel font. Several rows change very little from frame to frame, which is prototype-quality motion.

## Asset pipeline (for upcoming phases)

- Sprites: PNG, import preset **2D Pixel** (filter off, mipmaps off). One sheet per character, uniform cell size (planned 48×48 for the crew, 64×64 for bosses), with rows for idle 8 / walk 8 / run 8 / jump 6 / attack 8 / special 12 / hurt 4 / death 8 / victory 8 frames. These are built into `SpriteFrames` resources in `resources/characters/`.
- Audio: music as **OGG Vorbis**, loop enabled, in `assets/audio/music/`. SFX as OGG or WAV in `assets/audio/sfx/<id>.ogg`; these automatically replace the procedural placeholder with the same id.
- Font: drop an OFL-licensed pixel font into `assets/fonts/` and it gets wired into `NeonTheme` in Phase 2.
